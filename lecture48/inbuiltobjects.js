console.log("we will discuss about in-built objects in javascript:");
// javascript provides us in-built objects know as math object , we donesnt need to create this it is in built only it provides mathematical fuction for performing mathematical operations , is  used for performing mathematical function 
// there are many properties and methods over inbulit object for math object 
// properties 
// 1.math.pi
console.log("it is used to print pi value:", Math.PI);
// 2.math.e
console.log("it is used for printing erulers number:", Math.E);
// 3.math.ln2
console.log("it is used for calculate natural logarithm of 2:", Math.LN2);
// 4,math.ln10
console.log("it is used for calulating natural logarithm of 10:", Math.LN10);

// functions or methods()
// 1.math.random  0 inclusive and 1 exculsive
console.log(" it returns any random number between 0 to 1:", Math.random());
// 2.math.abs ,, it returns the absolute number of x , if any negative number is there then it returns the positive number 
console.log("if neagtive number is there then it returns positive number:", Math.abs(-8.9));
// 3.math.sqrt it is used to find a square root of a number 
console.log("this method is used for finding square root of number:", Math.sqrt(15));
// 4.math.pow it is used to find the power of the function ,, it takes two arguments x and y 
console.log("it is used to find pow of the number:", Math.pow(2,4));
// 5.math.floor it is used to find floor number of the given number 
console.log("it is used to find floor number:", Math.floor(5.7));
// 6.math.ceil it is used to find the ceil number of the given  number 
console.log("it is used to find ceil number : ", Math.ceil(9.4));
// 7.math.round it is used to find the round of the number
console.log("it is used to find round of the number:", Math.round(8.7));
console.log("it is used to find round of the number:", Math.round(5.4));
// 8.math.min it is used to find the minimum number or smallest number 
console.log("minimum number is:", Math.min(3, 8,55, 6, 1,7));
console.log("minimum number is:", Math.min( 7 , 3 , -4 ,-11, 10));
// 9.math.max it is used to find the maximum number 
console.log("maximum number is :", Math.max(67,34,1, -88,66));

// there is anothere in built method called date 
console.log("prnting the date:", Date());
// there are many methods on date when needed u can explore
